### Welcome to my website

My name is Joseph David. I am a Research and Teaching Assistant at the <a href="https://lbs.edu.ng" target="_blank">Lagos Business School, Pan-Atlantic Univerity </a>, Lagos, where I work with outstanding researchers on interesting and innovative research projects. I am also a Research Associate at Covenant University's Centre for Economic Policy and Development Research (CEPDeR). 

My main research interests are in public and development economics. From 2017 to date, I have worked on interesting and exciting research revolving around development economics, public finance, corruption, energy economics, and the economics of crime (with a bias in money laundering). My current research focuses on the determination of the quantum, flows, and laundering of illicit funds associated with criminal and illegal activities, including grand corrupt practices, kidnapping, terrorism, and tax evasion, amongst others, in Nigeria and Africa.
